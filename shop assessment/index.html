Is this legal?
<br>
<font face="microsoft sans serif" size=5 color=gray>
I can assure you this is most definitely %100 fully legal but just in case <br>
please don't tell the cops about this or show them our website, if the cops  <br> 
do find out we will track you down and I'll send my men to beat the crap out of you <br>
so like dont tell the cops and you wont die.
