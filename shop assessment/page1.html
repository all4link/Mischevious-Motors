Mercedes AMG one
<br>
<font face="microsoft sans serif" size=5 color=gray>
Found this car in a random garage in the middle of nowhere, <br> 
not quite sure how it got there but it was working mostly perfectly fine <br> 
anyway cleaned it up, got most of the spiders out (theres a big one <br>
in the back so be careful, we tried to get him out but he looked too scary <br>
so we left him in there) anyway yeah give me like 500 bucks and its yours

lambgini
<br>
<font face="microsoft sans serif" size=5 color=gray>
funny story: found it inside a toy store. not sure why it was there, <br>
definitely not a hint to any kind of scam we're pulling right now, <br>
it is most definitely a real genuine lambgini (not to be confused <br>
with lamborghini) so uh yeah give me 1000 dollars and its yours. <br>
(p.s: that man in the image is one of our certified mechanics who busy <br>
inspecting the car at the time that this photo was taken)

Tank
<br>
<font face="microsoft sans serif" size=5 color=gray>
So like funny story i got a mate who works for the military and <br>
he stole this tank for me  but like he actually got caught trying to steal <br>
it but luckily we were able to take the tank in exchange for giving the army free <br>
lamborghinis, so like I really hope we dont get caught up in this war because like <br>
the military is gonna be using lamborghinis which can't shoot the enemies anyway <br>
give me money
